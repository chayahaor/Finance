# Finance
This program is a tool for users to predict what will happen with their currency over time given the forward rate and 
foreign exchange rates they enter. The first page of the program is a sandbox where users can enter how much money they 
wish to begin with and add different actions that could be done with the money given certain specifactions of the action. 
Many "what if" actions can be added to the sandbox and the user can visualize what different 
actions will do to their finances.

The second page of the program is the environment where users can visualize possible profits and losses based on 
specifications they provide of potential actions they may perform with their finances. The user selects an action from a
dropdown menu, enters the original currency and the currency they wish to change to, the amount of money, forward price,
and date of maturity. A PnL chart shows a visual representation of the potential financial action.
